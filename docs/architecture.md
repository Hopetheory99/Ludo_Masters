## Codebase Scrutiny & Rating

### Code Quality
- Uses modern React (hooks, context, suspense, error boundaries)
- TypeScript throughout, strong type safety
- Modular structure, clear separation of concerns
- Uses best-practice libraries (Zustand, React Query, RainbowKit, Wagmi)
- Some use of `any` in types (should be reduced for stricter safety)

### Documentation
- Extensive docs: architecture, API, AI, tokenomics, project board, types, tasks
- Good inline code comments and TSDoc in types
- README is clear and feature-rich

### Test Coverage
- No explicit test files found in `src/` (add unit/integration tests for core logic and components)
- Testing libraries present in `package.json` (Testing Library, Jest)

### Architecture
- Scalable, modular, and extensible
- Clear context separation (Theme, Game, Auth, Web3)
- Web3 and AI integration points well defined

### Security & Best Practices
- Uses secure Web3 libraries and patterns
- Smart contract ABIs and config are modular
- No obvious security issues, but recommend code audits and more tests

### Weaknesses & Recommendations
- Reduce use of `any` in types for stricter type safety
- Add more unit/integration tests and CI for test coverage
- Continue expanding documentation as features grow
- Consider static analysis and security audit tools for smart contracts

## Overall Project Rating: **8.5/10**
- Excellent structure, documentation, and modern stack
- Needs more tests and stricter type safety for a perfect score

## Overview
Describe the high-level architecture of Ludo Masters, including frontend, backend, Web3 integration, and AI agent components.

See `architecture_diagram.md` for comprehensive system and data flow diagrams.

## Diagrams
- System Architecture Diagram (Mermaid)
- Data Flow Diagram (Mermaid)

## Data Flow
Explain how data moves between the client, server, blockchain, and AI modules.

## Core Game Engine Status & Next Steps

### Current State
- Modular React context (`GameContext`) manages game state, actions, and multiplayer events.
- Game reducer handles all state transitions (join, leave, move, roll, spectate, etc.).
- Utility functions for token movement, turn logic, and win conditions.
- Socket event handlers for real-time updates.

### Next Steps
- Review and improve Ludo board logic (token movement, win conditions, board coordinates).
- Add/refine unit and integration tests for game logic.
- Document game engine logic and architecture.
- Address any code gaps or TODOs.
